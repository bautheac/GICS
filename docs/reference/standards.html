    <p>The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) system was
  established in 1999 and has since become widely followed through direct
  use by portfolio managers and benchmarking to MSCI indexes. All told,
  more than 26,000 stocks worldwide have been classified by GICS,
  accounting for more than 95<!-- % of the world's listed market capitalization. -->
  MSCI estimates that more than $3 trillion in assets is benchmarked to
  its MSCI funds, many of which are sector-specific.The main goal of GICS
  is to allow all market participants to classify stocks by standardized
  industry definitions. GICS is used to make portfolio diversification and
  overall asset allocation decisions from within a common framework.GICS
  competes with the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) system, which
  is maintained by Dow Jones and London's FTSE Group. In practice, most of
  the same sector and industry designations exist in both standards. More
  recently, the usefulness of GICS classifications has been called into
  question. Many of our current economic measurements are still products of
  the Industrial Age: when the companies that were growing and shaping the
  world were giants with huge physical plants and plenty of material products
  — companies like Exxon Mobile and GE. Tech companies as we know them today
  hadn't even thought of it.Times have changed, but we still treat business
  entities as if they come from the traditional industry boundaries.
  Industry walls are disintegrating at a rapid pace. Over the past five
  years, the likes of Apple and Google have made significant moves into the
  automotive, healthcare, media, and smart home markets, among many others.
  GICS may classify them as part of the Information Technology sector, but
  we know their reach extends far beyond.Critics contend its time we move
  from a vertical industry emphasis to one centered on business models
  instead. By updating the Global Industry Classification Standard to
  reflect the wider view taken by today’s business winners - new measures
  and standards can help investors, customers and employees manage new
  strategic landscapes with greater insights.</p>
